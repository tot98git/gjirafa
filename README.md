# <h2 align="center">Gjirafa API</h2>


<h5 align="center"><a href="gjirafa.com">Gjirafa.com</a> offers a very useful service to check the bus schedule in Kosovo. They do not, however, offer an API or module which developers can use and present the information in services that assist people's needs such as a more compact website or mobile application. As such I have created this module that scraps the provider's website and returns the info in JSON format.</h5>
<br/>

## Installation
The module can be installed using ``npm install gjirafaapi``. The module is dependent on <strong><a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">Cheerio</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">Request native</a></strong>
